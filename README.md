In this competition I predicted the percentage of a Web3 loan that will be liquidated out of the total borrowed, I used data provided by Gora which used to do overcollateralized loans, something very innovative for blockchain Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as one can see in the notebook they were mostly successful and not many of the loans went over the Liquidated/Borrowed ratio resulting on bad loans. The best model turns out to be an AutoGluom model that has a RMSE of 0.06963

In case it is easier to check the results with the full evaluation file here it is since github does not allow files > 100 MB: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UnDKTT_n-bXpAZTcex5AVHu6HXpN3_QL/view?usp=sharing
