In this competition I predicted the percentage of a Web3 loan that will be liquidated out the total borrowed, I used data provided by Gora which used to do overcollaterillazied loans, something very innovative for blockchain Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as one can see in the notebook they were mostly successfull and not many of the loans went over the Liquidated/Borrowed ratio resulting on bad loans. The best model turns out to be an AutoGluom model that has a RMSE of 0.06963
